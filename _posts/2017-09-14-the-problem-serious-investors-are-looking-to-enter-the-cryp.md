  The Problem: Serious investors are looking to enter the crypto-currency market
  as part of their broad diversification strategy but are blocked from doing so
  in a meaningful way by the very distributed authority and anonymity that gives
  crypto-currency it’s power. The crypto-currency industry is blocked from
  accessing around 85% of the world’s wealth through fear of, and ignorance
  about, the risks and costs of compliance with the laws of major American and
  European jurisdictions.

The Problem: Serious investors are looking to enter the crypto-currency market as part of their broad diversification strategy but are blocked from doing so in a meaningful way by the very distributed authority and anonymity that gives crypto-currency it's power. The crypto-currency industry is blocked from accessing around 85% of the world's wealth through fear of, and ignorance about, the risks and costs of compliance with the laws of major American and European jurisdictions.
